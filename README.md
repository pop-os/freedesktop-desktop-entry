This crate provides a library for efficiently parsing [Desktop Entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html) files.

```rust
use freedesktop_desktop_entry::{default_paths, get_languages_from_env, Iter, PathSource};

fn main() {
    let locales = get_languages_from_env();
    for entry in Iter::new(default_paths()).entries(Some(&locales)) {
        let path_src = PathSource::guess_from(&entry.path);
        
        println!("{:?}: {}\n---\n{}", path_src, entry.path.display(), entry);
    }
}
```
